Latest Update
=====
I will be joining Zhejiang University as an Assistant Professor in July, and I am looking for self-motivated students to join us for conducting researches on mobile and IoT security. 

Brief Biography
=====
Li Lu received the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://www.sjtu.edu.cn) in 2020, with the advisors of Prof. [Jiadi Yu](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~jdyu/) and Prof. Minglu Li. He received the B.E. majoring in Computer Science and Technology and B.Admin in Business Administration from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn) in 2015. He has also visited Wireless Information Network Laboratory ([WINLAB](http://winlab.rutgers.edu/)) and [Dept. Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/) of [Rutgers University](http://www.rutgers.edu) under the supervision of Prof. [Yingying Chen](http://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/~yychen/) (IEEE Fellow).

Research Interests
======
His research interests include cyber security and privacy, mobile and ubiquitous computing, human-computer interactions. The main work is to employ signal processing and machine learning techniques in mobile sensing and communications to realize interesting and futuristic applications as well as investigate corresponding security problems underlying these applications. Previously, he also conducted theoretical researches on network economics and cloud computing.
